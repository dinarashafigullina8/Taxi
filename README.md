Data from AIT https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page  will be used as a dataframe.
How is the cost of the trip correlated with other factors? How can you explain this?

 Find abnormal trips. Why do you consider these trips to be abnormal?

 Build a distribution by the cost of trips. Check the hypothesis that it has a normal distribution. How can you explain this?

 From the data, build a model that describes the fare (i.e. the cost of the trip depends on other factors).

 Using the model from the point above, answer the question: were there any discounts or promotions on any days (or time intervals)? And if they were, then how can you explain it?
